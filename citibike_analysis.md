# Citi Bike Analysis

##Abstract
The CitiBike analysis is done to answer the questions if it is feasible to establish CitiBike branch the city of Des Moines. The analysis looks at population distribution, gender diversity and age distribution of Manhattan, NYC which already has successful network of profitable CitiBike stations. After thorough analysis is done on Manhattan population, I compare the population and other key factors between Des Moines and Manhattan to assess potential risks for the investment. Based on this analysis, investment in Des Moines seem to be a risky move.

## Manhattan, NYC (Slide 2,3)
The Manhattan has a vast network of 794 CitiBike stations that serves about 1.6 million population (Slide 2). Every day there are more than 2 million bike trips across the island with the peak times at 8AM and 5PM.

The population of Manhattan and impact on CitiBike Business (Slide 4),
Most of residents of the Manhattan are between 18-65 years old, which is the productive age. The second largest group is >65 year old and third is 5-18 years old. The smallest group is <5 years old. That population diversity impacts CitiBike income structure. The subscription population is dominated by group, 18-65 yo which is considered as productive age. Also, the trip duration distribution is dominated by the same group. Thus to be successful CitiBikes should look for society with similar age distribution.

Slide4. Population breakdown

## Comparison of populations Des Moines and Manhattan,NYC by age (Slide 5)

In both cities the dominant group is 18-65. However Des Moines has slightly larger fraction of 5-18yo than Manhattan and smaller 18-65yo. Also larger group of <5yo suggests younger society of Des Moines, but also potentially reduced income from Bike rental.

## Gender Distribution (Slide 6)

In Manhattan, NYC, the majority of CitiBike trips, ~54% are taken by men even though the women are dominant population 52.7%. Des Monies has population closer to equal with 49.2% of men and 50.8% of women. The 1.9% more men in Des Monies is equivalent to ~55 more clients in Manhattan, which is more profitable, but might not be enough to mitigate the impact of society distribution.

## Population Areal Distribution Comparison (Slide 7)

Two locations have very different population distribution map. Manhattan has large 1.6 million population that is uniformly distributed across the island. Des Moines has much smaller population of 216,853 that is concentrated around the downtown and spread in the suburbs. That impose additional non uniform distribution of CitiBike stations and brings a risk of “missing” potential customers.

## Income Comparison (Slide 8)

The median income in Des Moines per household per month is $2,227 which is almost 3x lower than in Manhattan, 6,069. On the other hand, the rent difference is just2x. The rent in Des Moines is $822 and in Manhattan is $1,682. The same ratio is for households spending with and without mortgage.
Des Moines unemployment level is 4.6%, which is higher than Manhattan NYC 3.6% and the poverty level is 17% in Des Moines vs. 15.6% in Manhattan. These economical underperformance puts significant risk to CitiBike investment in Des Moines.
